# RegEasy

This software, inspired by RegRipper, provides a way to intuitively extracting relevant information from the Windows registry. Each page provides an option to parse a specific registry file. Once you're on the page that corresponds to the registry file you want to parse, you'll have two options:

1) Select a drive
For this option you can select any drive connected to your computer, and the program will automatically search that drive for the specified registry file to parse the information for you.

2) Select a registry file
If you have already extracted the registry file you want to parse, then you can use this option to select that registry file directly.

From here, you will be able to select from the checkboxes available to extract whatever information you need.
